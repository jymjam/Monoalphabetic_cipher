### Monoalphabetic cipher implementation in python
No extra dependencies; just download and run with python3.X

To Do (part 2):
- [ ] Enhance encryption security to beat cryptanalysis
- [ ] Perform frequency analysis on new implementation
- [ ] draft a report.

    monoalphabetic keys. 
- [x] Program to detect all characters and symbols used in Java 
    and perform frequency analysis.
- [x] Program to guess the encryption/decryption key using 
    cryptanalysis.
